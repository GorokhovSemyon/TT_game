## Gameplay
### General
To move the left racket, use the keys `'A'` and `'Z'` ('a' and 'z'), for the right - `'K'` and `'M'` ('k' and 'm'). To exit the game, you need to press `'Esc'` or wait for one of the players to win.

With standard settings, the game ends when one of the players scores 15 points.

### For step by step version
To skip step press `'Space'`, to enter next move press `'Enter'`

### For dynamic version
> Since only one input stream is used, when holding the control keys of the racket or when pressing intensively, the racket can move for some time by "inertia".
